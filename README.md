I developed a WPF photo-sharing gallery application for beauty salons and ateliers using MVVM architecture and WCF for implementing the communication layer.
Ateliers & their customers can use this application to select their best photos, share them & save time.

### Features:
- Add, Update and Delete Image Galleries
- Sub Galleries
- Sync Galleries using WCF
- Clean coded using MVVM-architecture
